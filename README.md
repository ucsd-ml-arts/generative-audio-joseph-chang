# Project 3 Generative Audio

Joseph Chang, jdchang@ucsd.edu

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to produce music using speech. A person will write whatever lyrics they want and DeepVoice will translate it into speech. Performance RNN is used separately to produce a music pieces based on various genres mixed together. Gansynth then interpolates the various music pieces generated. Finally, the singing speech and music can be combined on Garage Band. This could be very useful for artists to experiment with new music.

Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
